  <h2>Repetition and Contrast Exercise</h2>
  <p>For today's exercise, we start out with a multi-page website that has been partially developed in html and css. I have written the html for the first page of content (index.html) and added style rules to the external style sheet (style.css) that establish a rough layout for the site. To complete the exercise you will need to complete the css stylesheet by adding rules (described below) which establish contrast and repetition. You will then need to make the other three pages of the site (about.html, issues.html and volunteer.html) consistent with the design you have established in the css by updating the html for these pages. </p>
  <h3>Getting Started</h3>
  <p>To start the exercise, open index.html in your browser and in atom. Open index.html in atom as well.</p>
  <p><em>NOTE: The picture of "Susan Smith" actually depicts Second Lady of the United States Jill Biden (it was a freely available appropriate headshot, ok?). Fill text for the site was generated by the hipster fill-text tool: <a href="http://hipsum.co/">Hipster Ipsum</a></em></p>
  <p>Take a minute to notice the overall layout of the design in your browser. This is a single-column design, with a simple header, navigation bar, and content area. The image of "Susan" is floated to the right. If you resize the browser, notice that the single column does not change size in response to the changing size of your browser window. This is called a <em>Fixed Layout</em> and we will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this sort of layout in a couple of weeks.</p>
  <p>Also notice that the navigation links don't quite line up on the same center line as the heading. This is an alignment problem! There is a fix for this, but it would have made the css more complicated than I wanted for today's exercise. More about that when we discuss proximity next week.</p>
  <h3>Updating the CSS</h3>
  <p>Once you have a sense of the overall design, it's time to open up the css and get to work! Open style.css, which located in the css folder, in atom. Once you have it open:
    <ol>
      <li>Use a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-image">background-image</a> property to specify that the header tag should have as its background the image file "flag.jpg" located in the "images" folder. The background-image property allows us to set an image as the background for our element! As the documentation on MDN explains, it takes the weird-looking value: url("PATH_TO_IMAGE"). Think of this value as working like the "src" attribute on images. Just as in the "src" attribute, we specify the location of an image by using either a web address, or the file path of a local file. In this case, we want to specify the local file "flag.jpg" located in the images folder. Because the images folder is one level <em>above</em> the location of our style.css, your file path will need to use the ".." operator, just as we practiced before break.</li>
      <li>Use a simple color extraction tool to pull some colors out of our background image that we can then repeat across the rest of our design. Go to the <a href="http://labs.tineye.com/color/">Tin Eye color tool</a> and upload flag.jpg. The tool will provide you with a list of html colors drawn from the image. <em>(NOTE: There are a LOT of other tools that will accomplish this task. For example, image editors like Photoshop and the Gimp will allow you to pull colors out of images in a much more controlled way. However, for today the Tin Eye tool made sense because it is quick, free and easy to use.)</em>
        <li>Apply colors from our background image to the following elements on the page. Choose two or three colors to <em>repeat</em> to create a consistent design. Think about the warmth of the color, and text readability before applying your color. You may also use the color white, if contrast demands it.
          <ul>
            <li>Nav tag (background color)</li>
            <li>Nav tag border</li>
            <li>A tags within the nav tag (color)</li>
            <li>Body tag (background color)</li>
            <li>Heading One Two and Three (color)</li>
            <li>Maincolumn id (background color)</li>
          </ul></li>
         <li> Use a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/list-style-image">list-style-image property</a> to set the bullet point for unordered lists to the image "star.png" located in the images folder. The list style image has the same syntax as the background-image, including the weird url() value, but it sets the image for a list bullet, rather than the background image for an element. Notice the star image uses one of the colors from our background, and repeats the star motif from the flag.</li>
         <li>Finally, add more contrast to your page by adjusting the font-family, font-size, and font-weight for the following elements (NOTE: I have included two google fonts 'Lato' and 'Alike' in the css by using @import statements, you can use these in the font-family property in the css):
           <ul>
             <li>Heading level 1 2 and 3</li>
             <li>Maincolumn text</li>
           </ul>
         </li>
       </ol>
    <h3>Updating the HTML</h3>
    <p>Once you have the css updated, you need to update the html of the other three pages: about.html, volunteer.html, and issues.html to apply your design consistently to these pages. To do this:
      <ol>
        <li>Add a link element to the header of each page to include style.css on the page</li>
        <li>Add the header tag and headings from index.html to each page</li>
        <li>Wrap the text on each page in a div with the id "maincolumn" and then add heading level three, paragraph, and list tags as needed.</li>
      </ol>
</body>
</html>
